# Color-Detection-In-Images
A project in Computer vision, the programming language used Python and its different libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and OpenCV library, this project will help in detecting any color on the image wherever double-clicked on the image.


#---------------------Welcome to this project on Color Detection using OpenCV--------------------------------
*
*
*Prerequisites:
*
*Basic knowledge of Pandas and Numpy
*
*Steps for implementing/running this Project on your system:
*
*
*Step 1: first install python on your system from the folowing link https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe
*
*Step 2: Set the enviroment variable for running python code to the path
*
*Step 3: Use any editor of your choice and create a .py file.
*
*Step 4: now run these commands on terminal
*            pip install numpy
*            pip install pandas
*            pip install opencv-python
*
*
*
*
*Now you can run the program and make modifications in it.
